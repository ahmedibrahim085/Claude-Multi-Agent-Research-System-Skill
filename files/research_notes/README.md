# Research Notes

This directory contains research notes generated by researcher agents.

## How It Works

When you run a research query:
1. The multi-agent-researcher skill decomposes your question into 2-4 subtopics
2. Specialized researcher agents are spawned in parallel
3. Each researcher creates a research note file here: `{subtopic-slug}.md`

## File Naming

Format: `{subtopic-slug}.md`

Example:
- `local-llm-options-setup.md`
- `agentic-rag-architectures.md`
- `claude-code-integration-patterns.md`

## Contents

Each research note includes:
- Executive summary
- Key findings with evidence
- Source citations
- Confidence levels
- Research metadata

These notes are then synthesized by the report-writer agent into a comprehensive report in `files/reports/`.
