# Research Reports

This directory contains comprehensive synthesis reports generated by the report-writer agent.

## How It Works

After all researcher agents complete their work:
1. The orchestrator spawns the report-writer agent
2. Report-writer reads all research notes from `files/research_notes/`
3. Synthesizes findings into a comprehensive, structured report
4. Saves the report here with a timestamped filename

## File Naming

Format: `{topic-slug}_{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md`

Example:
- `local-llm-agentic-rag-claude-code_20251117-120000.md`
- `quantum-computing-fundamentals_20251117-143022.md`

## Contents

Each synthesis report includes:
- Executive Summary
- Key Findings (cross-referenced from research notes)
- Detailed Analysis by subtopic
- Cross-Cutting Themes
- Contradictions and Debates
- Gaps and Limitations
- Recommendations
- Source Bibliography

Reports are comprehensive (typically 8,000-15,000 words) with citations to original research notes.
