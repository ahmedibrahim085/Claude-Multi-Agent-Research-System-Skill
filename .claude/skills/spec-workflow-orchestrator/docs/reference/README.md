## spec-orchestrator-original.md

**Purpose**: Original orchestrator agent file from zhsama/claude-sub-agent project

**Why it's here**:
- This was the SOURCE for extracting battle-tested workflow patterns into SKILL.md
- Contains orchestration logic, quality gates, best practices, and templates
- NOT a spawnable agent - the SKILL.md itself acts as the orchestrator
- Kept as reference for understanding the origin of workflow patterns

**Content extracted to SKILL.md**:
- Orchestration workflow (Phase 1 Planning & Analysis activities)
- Quality gate validation criteria (4 core criteria, 85% threshold)
- Feedback framework (4-part: analysis, action, communication, feedback)
- Progress tracking templates (status report format)
- Best practices (5 project coordination principles)
- Examples (web application planning template)

**Status**: Archived reference (not used at runtime)
